As it turned out, the used version of **go-cron** did not work reliably any more. The image now includes a newer version which should fix those problems.

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Update go-cron [\#12](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/12) ([djmaze](https://github.com/djmaze))

**Fixed bugs:**

- Replace go-cron with crond from the already included BusyBox [\#11](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/issues/11)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/tree/1.0.0) (2019-10-24)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/compare/0.9.5...1.0.0)

In this release, there are a couple of new features. Also, Restic itself has not been updated in a while. So it makes sense to switch to our own versioning scheme now. In order to indicate this change, we are now continuing with 1.0.0.

The new version does not indicate any kind of stability or feature freeze. It is just a new numbering scheme which is now uncoupled from the Restic version in use. 

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Post commands [\#8](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/8) ([nikkoura](https://github.com/nikkoura))
- Support `rclone` [\#6](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/6) ([maximbaz](https://github.com/maximbaz))
- Fix various things & add support for precommands [\#3](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/3) ([jlelse](https://github.com/jlelse))

**Fixed bugs:**

- "syntax error: unexpected redirection" when using PRE\_COMMANDS [\#4](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/issues/4)
- Fix PRE\_COMMANDS error \('unexpected redirection'\) [\#7](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/7) ([nikkoura](https://github.com/nikkoura))
